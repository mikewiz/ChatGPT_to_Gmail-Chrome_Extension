# ChatGPT_to_Gmail-Chrome_Extension
This JavaScript script is part of 'Michael's Exotic Peppers Email Assistant' Chrome Extension. It monitors Gmail's DOM for the "Reply" button in email threads. Upon clicking, it captures the email content, sends it to a background script for processing with OpenAI, and auto-fills the generated GPT response into the reply textbox.
